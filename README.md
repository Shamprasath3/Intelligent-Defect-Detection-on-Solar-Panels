ðŸš€ How SolarGuard Works: The AI Pipeline
Data Ingestion & Preprocessing (Powered by Tucker Port)
Users upload images or ZIP archives of solar panels representing different conditions. Tucker Port handles seamless data management, extracting, cleaning, and normalizing images for the next stages.

Condition Classification (ML Model with Merit Software Enhancements)
A refined Random Forest classifier quickly analyzes panel images to predict one of six key conditions: Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical Damage, Physical Damage, or Snow-Covered. Merit Software optimizes training and inference pipelines for lightning-fast, resource-efficient performance.

Defect Localization (Custom YOLOv5 Object Detection)
For actionable diagnostics, SolarGuard uses a custom-trained YOLOv5 model to detect and pinpoint defectsâ€”like dust spots, bird droppings, and physical or electrical damageâ€”directly on the panel images, highlighting exact problem areas.

Insightful Visualization & Recommendations
Users receive clear, annotated images showing defect locations alongside smart maintenance advice, empowering solar technicians to prioritize cleaning and repairs precisely where neededâ€”saving time and costs.

Why SolarGuard is Next-Gen
Hybrid AI Approach: Merges broad condition classification with fine-grained defect detection for a full-spectrum view.

Optimized Workflow: Integrates Tucker Port and Merit Software for robust, scalable, and efficient data processing.

Real-Time Ready: Designed for rapid inference, enabling near real-time monitoring.

Action-Driven Output: Goes beyond detection by providing practical, targeted recommendations.
